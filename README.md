## 📖 Project Overview

Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges, with potential implications for agriculture, food availability and international markets.

This project explores how climate indicators, natural disasters, agricultural production, food trade and food prices evolved between **2000 and 2024** through an interactive Power BI dashboard built using publicly available datasets.

> **The objective is not to establish causal relationships, but to identify historical trends, patterns and possible connections across multiple domains.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global temperature trends.
- Explore the evolution of natural disasters.
- Compare agricultural production across key commodities.
- Analyze international food trade dynamics.
- Monitor food and cereals price evolution.
- Summarize the main findings through interactive dashboards.
